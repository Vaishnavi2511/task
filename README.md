# task
I have used MEAN stack(MongoDB Express Node.js Angular) for this assignment
MongoDB is used as database
I have used two schemas : reg and clog
Reg is for user registration and clog is for blogs
Reg consists of name,email and password 
clog consists of heading , content,image,name and postedby
i have used express-session to create sessions for users
Various html pages are created for different pages
get and post request are used for each url
pages in my website
1. homepage : It consists of list of blogs , option to add blog and login and signup . It also consists some information about the site
2. login : it consists of signup and login form
3. user dashboard : here user can see their already added blogs and can add, update or delete their blogs
4. edit : user can use this page to edit their already added blog
5. delete : user can use this page to delete their already added blog
Installed various packages for this purpose like express-session,mongoose,multer,body-parser,ejs,express
